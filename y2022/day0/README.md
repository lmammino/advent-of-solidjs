[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

For this challenge, you're tasked with building a local two-player Tic Tac Toe game. Even though you probably know the overall gameplay and rules, I thought I'd give you a quick rundown anyway, just in case you needed it to better visualise or plan out a solution.

In Tic Tac Toe, two players take turns and place their symbols (ie. a circle and a cross) on a board which consists of three rows with three cells each. The starting order can be decided randomly. The first person to fill a row, or a column, or a diagonal exclusively with their symbol - wins. If nobody manages to do that, the game ends in a draw.

## Example solution screenshots

Note that you don't have to replicate the styling 1:1 or use Tailwind to solve this puzzle. The following screenshots are meant to give you a better idea as to how the target app is supposed work:
